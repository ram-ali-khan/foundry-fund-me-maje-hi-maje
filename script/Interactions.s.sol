/****************************************
 * what are scripts actually??
 * *************************************
 * In Foundry, a script refers to a special kind of Solidity or JavaScript file used to interact with smart contracts, perform complex testing, or deploy contracts. The script folder in a Foundry project is typically where these scripts are stored.

    Purpose of the script folder:

	1.	Deployment: Scripts can be written to automate the deployment of contracts to different networks (e.g., local, testnet, or mainnet). This helps avoid manual deployment using tools like Remix or command-line interfaces.
	2.	Interactions: Once a contract is deployed, you can use scripts to interact with the contract, such as calling its functions, transferring tokens, or checking balances.
	3.	Testing and Simulation: You can create more advanced tests or simulate real-world interactions within these scripts to see how contracts behave in various scenarios.
	4.	Utility Functions: Scripts can include helper functions or setup code that prepare the environment for running tests or deployments, for example:
	â€¢	Setting up required addresses, mock tokens, or configurations.

// 1. write Fund Script
// 2. wtite Withdraw script
/* ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
  jaise pehle unit tests me hame bar bar deployfundme ka use krna tha to uski ek script likh di thi.
 ab integration test me hame bar bar deployfundme k sath fundfundme and withdrawfundme ka use krna padega to unke liye do script or likh di. and also while writing these two scripts we needed a deployed fundme(jisko fund denge ya withdraw karenge), jiske liye hmne devops ka use kia
