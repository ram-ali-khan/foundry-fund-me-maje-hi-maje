when i ever listen to the song Born to shine, diljit is second and lovish sir is still the first 
thing that comes in my head. His favourite song and also what defines him. 

i met my second mentor(could be called first one) for the first time during MSES team selection. As soon as we met, I knew that this senior was my type and that our vibes were matching. and after that i never stoped knocking 
his door, for acads, por, poltu, or any kind of problem. 






Whenever I hear the song "Born to Shine," Lovish Sir is the first person that comes to mind. It’s his favorite song and honestly, it suits him perfectly.

I first met my second mentor (who might as well be the first) during the MSES team selection. From the moment we met, I could tell this senior was my kind of person. Our vibes just clicked. Since then, I've lost count of the times I've gone to him for help—whether it was for studies, PORs, hostel politics, or any random problem, he was always there to guide me. 

Sir has done so much for Aravali Hostel. He practically built the MSES Society from scratch, turning it into something we all take pride in. I’ve also seen him contributing to and achieving in every music and drama event. Although I don’t know much about music, Ashish Sir told me that Lovish Sir is fantastic with variations in singing and can play every instrument, from cajón to drums.

While others were struggling to get a decent job, he got a PPO and later got selected for IIM, showing how smart and hardworking he is. It’s no surprise https://xhamster.com/videos/clair-xhV6DpG that he was awarded the ‘Pride of Aravali’.

Lovish Sir, you’re not just an awesome senior—you’re someone we all look up to. You’ve set a great example for all of us, and I’m sure wherever you go, tussi eddan ee shine karde rehna.
